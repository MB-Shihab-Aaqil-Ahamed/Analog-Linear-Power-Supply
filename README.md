## Abstract

The Analog Linear Power Supply project focuses on designing a 10V linear power supply capable of delivering up to 10A of current. The project involves multiple stages, including step-down transformation, full-wave rectification, smoothing, voltage regulation, and current limiting. The design also incorporates protection mechanisms for overload and short circuit conditions.

## Introduction

The Analog Linear Power Supply project aims to provide a reliable and stable voltage and current output for high-power loads. This is achieved through a multi-stage process that involves transforming the input voltage, rectification, voltage smoothing, regulation, and current limiting. The project addresses challenges associated with handling high current while minimizing current error.

## Methodology

The methodology of the project involves the following key stages:

1. Step Down Transformer: A step-down transformer is used to reduce the 230V input voltage to a more manageable level.

2. Full-Wave Rectification: The GBPC3506W Bridge rectifier is used to rectify the voltage, converting it into pulsating DC.

3. Smoothing Stage: A 10mF capacitor is employed to smooth the rectified output, reducing voltage ripples.

4. Regulating Stage: The regulated voltage is achieved using two transistors (MJ4502 and BC547A as Sziklai pair), a 10V Zener diode, a 150â„¦ resistor, and a diode.

5. Current Limiting Stage: The circuit incorporates a current limiting mechanism to restrict the maximum current output to 10A.
